# Spark Commodities API Code Samples

Welcome to the Spark Commodities API Code Samples repository! ðŸš€ 

By signing up to the 
[Spark Commodities platform](https://app.sparkcommodities.com) and 
[creating your client credentials](https://app.sparkcommodities.com/data-integrations/api#api-manage), 
subject to the your organisation's subscription status, youâ€™ll be able to utilise 
Sparkâ€™s API. The API allows for a large amount of Spark data shown on the platform to be

- Accessing both spot prices and Sparkâ€™s extensive database of historical data,
  allowing you to dig deeper into market trends.
- Automating Spark data feeds directly into your existing analysis scripts
- Recreating charts and tables seen on the platform
- Extending functionality beyond the platform, and producing your own complex analysis 
  products and chart types
